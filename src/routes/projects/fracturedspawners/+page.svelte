    <p>FracturedSpawners adds the ability to break and then repair spawners.</p>
    <p>When breaking a spawner, it will drop a "Fractured Spawner". You can then use 4 diamonds and 4 echo shards to repair it, and turn it into a "Repaired Spawner", which you can then place and use as normal.</p>

    <p>This plugin uses bStats for analytics, the data collected is completely anonymous. If you would like to disable bStats, you can do so in the bStats config file.</p>
    <p>From the bStats website: </p>
    <p>"bStats does not collect any personal data. Most of the collected data is information about the plugin's server like player count, online mode, Minecraft version, Java version, and more. All data gets sent and stored completely anonymously. Server IPs are only stored for ratelimiting and not linked to the data. All data that is collected is publicly visible. If you are interested in what data is collected for your Minecraft server, take a look at the pages for the plugins on your server. Please note that plugin authors can also send data that is customized for their plugin."</p>
